# Universal Bedrock Library V 0.1.0 WIP
 A Bedrock Library to unite universal addon stuff (mainly ingots and ores)
 Most textures are from [Emendatus Enigmatica Java Mod](https://github.com/Ridanisaurus/EmendatusEnigmatica) so if you want to congratulate someone it should be Ridanisaurus which is the most talented minecraft texture maker Ive seen, so go check his work out

## Addon Creator?
 -The target: dont fall into the same problem that modded Java had with having different variations of the same thing. Addon creators out there just have to copy code and textures from this library so that when users download addons they dont have to deal with having to get all the ingot/ores/etc variations for the things that every addon provide. 
 
 -Recomendations: 
 
 *If you are an addon creator please use this library... I also highly recomend taking a look at the set of "[guidelines](#guidelines-total-wiiiip)" that a lot of things have (They explain which items are used for ore processing, which are only for gems, which are only for metals, what every alloy are made of regardless of their crafting process which is up to you, the biomes, dimentions, and y levels of ores, and much more!) that is just to make every material in every addon follow the same guidelines. 
 
 *If you are planning on adding an ingot/ore or something that you think others could have a variation of in their addon that is not on this library I highly recomend for you to use the "universal:..." Identifier so that when users use your addons they'll combine more seamlessly with others
